# REACT COMPONENTS

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

This project is a collection of reusable React components designed to enhance web application development. It includes a variety of UI components such as alerts, accordions, scroll indicators, star ratings, and many more. These components are built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy integration and customization within different projects.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of this project at [https://prashantsingh181.github.io/react-components/](https://prashantsingh181.github.io/react-components/). This site showcases the various components in action, providing a real-world example of how they can be integrated and utilized within a web application.

## Styling

This project utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is highly customizable and allows for rapid UI development. By leveraging Tailwind, the components in this project benefit from a consistent design system and a streamlined workflow for creating responsive designs.

For more information on how to get started with Tailwind CSS or to explore its features, please visit the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
